Here is the code for our COMP 370 final project, a data analysis about media coverage of Taylor Swift. Here are quick summaries of each file.

'annotated_articles.csv': the dataset we obtained after annotation was complete.

'taylor swift api.py': the script we used to query NewsAPI to obtain our dataset.

'assigning_coders_to_csv.py': the script which we used to randomly choose articles for open coding and assign coders to them.

'article_counts.py': the script which was used to count the number of articles in each category (both topic and tone)

'tfidf_calculation.py': the script which calculated the top ten words resulting from tfidf analysis in each category
